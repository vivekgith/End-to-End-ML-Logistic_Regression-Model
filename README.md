# End-to-End-ML-Logistic_Regression-Model
Toy Dataset Machine Learning Project
This repository demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using a simple toy dataset. The project includes:
Data loading and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature selection and transformation
Model training using different ML algorithms
Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, metrics)
Visualizations for better understanding
The aim of this project is to practice ML fundamentals and establish a solid foundation for building real-world data science projects.
